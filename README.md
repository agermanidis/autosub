# Autosub

This is a modified verson of [Autosub](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub) with added arguments for minimum and maximum region size (length of audio to be transcribed in each "subtitle").

Personally I found this very convenient when using autosub to transcribe interviews (yes, autosub works great for that application), but it might be useful in other cases too.

Added arguments:
  -m MIN, --min MIN     Minimum region size
  -M MAX, --max MAX     Maximum region size
